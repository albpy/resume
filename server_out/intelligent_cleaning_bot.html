    <h1>Controlled obstacle detector</h1>

    <h2></h2>
    <p>
        This was my simple intention to reproduce the obstacle detection robot but with an ability to intelligently clean the space. It has 2 wheels, ultrasonic sensor as the detection eye.
        Lack of required mechanical parts faced during the development. Functionalities are almost completed, however certain mechanical constraints are still there which will explain at end.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Roadmap</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Design and build the robot's hardware structure.</li>
        <li>Implement software to control the robot's movements.</li>
        <li>Integrate sensors for obstacle detection and navigation.</li>
        <li>Test the robot's functionality in different scenarios.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Components Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li> Arduino Uno R3/ 328p</li>
        <li> 2  Hobby [BO] Gearmotor </li>
        <li> Ultrasonic sensor[HC-sr04] </li>
        <li>  DC Motor </li>
        <li> Power Supply: as required to drive the load</li>
        <li> Chassis </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Build Process</h2>
    <p>
        The first step in the project was to design the robot's chassis. 
        There are pre-designed 3D priable CAD models available. I've ordered the chassis from a popular online store.
        Ensure the chasis would accommodate all components securely.

    <p>
        After completing the design, I proceeded with assembling the components. The microcontroller was mounted on the chassis, 
        followed by the motors.Printing the circuit on a PCB results in a more compact design. But Due to the lack of circuit printing services, I used 
        the jumper wires to connect between, which is roomier. Thus struggled to debug and there is more chances to mis-wiring. 
        For successfull outcome pcb is preffered.

        <p>Firmware:</p>
        <p>The firmware contains the functions for various controlling motions like forward, backward, left, etc and the distance detection function. One should incoporate both to get intelligent movement of the bot.</p>
        <p>The firmware is hosted on GitHub, where you can find the source code, documentation, and instructions for building and deploying the firmware. Visit the following link to explore the project:</p>

    <h2>Testing and Results</h2>
    <p>
        Once the assembly and coding were complete, you can the robot in various environments to ensure it performed as expected. 
        The robot was able to successfully navigate around obstacles and reach its destination. Currently the breadboard jumper design is not much efficient and 
        a compact pcb design will be updated.

        This was a great experience. It provided insights into electronics and programming. I look forward to further refining the design and adding more features in the future.
